### Hi there! üëã

I'm **Raja Babu** (He/Him), a final-year Computer Science undergrad (B.Tech '26) at **IIT (ISM) Dhanbad**.

I'm passionate about building impactful solutions at the intersection of **Full Stack Development** and **Machine Learning**. I'm actively honing my ML skills, having participated in the **Amazon Machine Learning Summer School ('24)**, and I'm excited to be joining **Amazon** as an upcoming **SDE Intern**.

Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source, and tackling challenges in competitive programming.
